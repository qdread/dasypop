## Contents

The code is in three Markdown notebooks containing a combination of R code and Bash commands:

- `dasypop_methods.md`: the code to generate dasymetric population estimates by county
- `validation_figure.md`: uses the estimates generated in the previous notebook and compares their performance against other existing estimates using flood and wildfire risk data
- `methods_figure.md`: generates a figure illustrating the estimation process

## How to run

See the individual notebooks for instructions on how to run the code and download the necessary external data. The code in the `dasypop_methods.md` notebook should be run first.
